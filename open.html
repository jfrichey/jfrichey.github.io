    <h1>Random random</h1>

    A collection of probability/combinatorics questions I like.
    <p></p>

    <a href="pagedocs/sft_patterns.pdf">Combinatorics for shifts of finite type.</a> An ever-evolving writeup of
    combinatorial and probability questions for pattern-avoiding words, aka shifts of finite type.

    <p></p>

    <a href="pagedocs/combinatorial_processes.pdf">Combinatorial stochastic processes.</a> An ever-evolving catalog of
    probability models and questions, including particle processes, diffusions, martingales, and random number theory.

    <p></p>

    <a href="pagedocs/sum_constructions.pdf">Sum constructions.</a> Questions related to sumsets of real numbers.

    <p></p>

    <a href="pagedocs/rw_collisions.pdf">Collisions among random walks.</a> A survey I wrote as a graduate student about
    collision times among independent random walkers. Contains a brief literature review, plus some original computations
    for simple random walks on the integers and a finite cycle.

    <p></p>

    <a href="pagedocs/geo_coupons23.pdf">Statistics for coupon collection.</a> Consider an iid sequence
    of random variables drawn from some probability measure on the integers. What can we say about the set of values
    collected up to some time? The theory of large deviations describes the empirical measure, and thus can describe
    the 'coupon set,' up to some error, so more delicate methods are necessary. This note computes, for a certain class
    of light tailed measures, the limiting distribution of a certain statistic defined over the 'coupon set.'
