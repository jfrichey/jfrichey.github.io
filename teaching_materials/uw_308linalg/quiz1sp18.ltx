\hspace{3cm} Two limes, one basket of blueberries, and three pears costs 13 dollars

\hspace{3cm} One lime and five baskets of blueberries costs 11 dollars

\hspace{3cm} One lime and one pear costs 4 dollars

Use Jacob's data to write a system of three linear equations in the variables $L =  $ cost of one lime, $ B=$ cost of one basket of blueberries, and $P = $ cost of one pear.
