\begin{enumerate} \item Let $z = 3x\sin(y), x = 3t^2-1, y = \tan(t)$. Use the chain rule to find $\frac{\partial z}{\partial t}$ at the point $t = 1$. 

\item Let $z = e^{x-y}, x =  -t-1, y = 1.$ Use the chain rule to find $\frac{\partial z}{\partial t}$ at the point $t = -2$. 

\item Find the gradient of $f(x,y) = 17y-2xy^2$, and use it to compute the directional derivative of $f$ at the point $(8,1)$ in the direction of the unit vector $u = \frac{1}{\sqrt{17}} \langle -4, 1 \rangle$. 

\item Find the gradient of $f(x,y) = y^2 - x^3 - 2xy$, and find the value of the gradient at the point $(1,1)$. Are there any other points $(x,y)$ where the gradient vector is parallel to the vector $\hat{i}$? What are they?

\item Find the two points on the ellipsoid $\frac{x^2}{4}+\frac{y^2}{9} + z^2 = 1$ where the tangent plane to the ellipsoid at those points is normal to the vector $v = \langle 1, 1, -2 \rangle$. 

\item (Stewart 16.1, 11-14). Match the given vector fields with the plots. (Pictures in the text.)

\item Does there exist a function $f(x,y,z)$ with $\nabla f =yz^2 \hat{i} + xz^2 \hat{j} + 2xyz \hat{k}$? Either find a function $f$ that works, or explain why there is no such function. 


%\item[8.] Let $f(x,y,z) = x+yz$, and let $C$ be the line segment from $(0,0,0)$ to $(6, 2, 2)$. Give a linear parameterization of $C$ that traverses the segment in one time unit, and evaluate $\int_C f(x,y,z) ds$. Do the same integral with the parameterization $(6t^2, 2t^2, 2t^2), 0 \leq t \leq 1$ of the line segment. (Should we get the same answer both times?)

\end{enumerate}
