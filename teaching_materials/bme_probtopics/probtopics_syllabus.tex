% Syllabus Section
\noindent \textbf{Course outline}: This course will survey results and theories related to fundamental models originating in pure probability and physics, with a focus on simple random walks, percolation theory, and first passage percolation. Questions and ideas related to these models have guided research advances throughout the 20th century, and recent international prizes have been awarded to scholars who touched these problems, including Duminil-Copin, Furstenberg, Kesten, Lawler, and Talagrand. The product has been new and elegant mathematics -- including potential theory, correlation inequalities, and Busemann functions, to name a few -- though many challenges still remain today.
