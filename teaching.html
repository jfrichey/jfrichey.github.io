        My formal teaching career started in 2015, when I served as junior staff at <a href="http://www.hcssim.org/">HCSSiM</a>,
        6 years after I had attended as a student, in 2009! I was young, nervous, and constantly both excited and exhausted. It was a rewarding and formative experience.
        (The same adjectives apply to my summers as a student and as a staffer.) You can contribute financial aid for students of the program by making a donation <a href="https://hcssim.org/online-giving/">here</a>.
        <p></p>
        As a grad student and postdoc I have been the lead instructor for 15+ undergraduate courses in probability, linear algebra, and multivariable calculus. Repository with materials from some past undergraduate courses: <a href="https://github.com/jfrichey/jfrichey.github.io/tree/a24e74440bcdd172b0093a8c1a7550ed916bc78b/teaching_materials">link</a>.
        <p></p>
        From 2016-2020 I led the 2nd year of the <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~mathcircle/circle/">UW Math Circle</a>.
        <a href="https://lucasvanmeter.github.io/">Lucas van Meter</a> and I ran weekly 2-3 hour sessions with a diverse group of 7th-8th grade students.
        We cooked up our own lesson plans in game theory, group theory, probability, and geometry, and experimented constantly with material and teaching methods.

        <p></p>
        I mentored multiple groups of undergraduates in math research projects as part of <a href="https://wxml.math.washington.edu/">WXML</a> at
        the UW and <a href="https://www.uroubc.com/rex/">REX</a> at UBC. In 2014 I gave a talk at UW's <a href="https://www.math.washington.edu/~reu/index.html">REU</a>,
        and mentored a student project in percolation that resulted in a publication: <a href="https://www.math.washington.edu/~reu/papers/2015/natalie/natalie.pdf">link</a>.
