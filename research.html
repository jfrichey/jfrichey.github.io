            <br>

            Fix a set a set of 'forbidden' patterns on a transitive graph, i.e. a finite set of colorings of
            some finite subgraphs. Consider an iid coloring the full graph conditioned to avoid all of the forbidden patterns.
            What does a typical configuration look like, and what statistical properties does it have? This model originated
            in ergodic theory and symbolic dynamics, and lies at the intersection of probability, combinatorics, dynamics, and statistical physics.
            Many interesting questions arise already in the one dimensional setting. For example: consider bi-infinite binary words, and
            forbid a single binary pattern. The entropy of the resulting shift space (i.e. the exponential growth rate
            of the number of allowable words) is described by a simple combinatorial statistic, the auto-correlation polynomial
            of the forbidden word. Another natural object is the asymptotic density of 1s, or of another fixed (allowable) pattern. Is there a
            similar combinatorial statistic that describes these densities?

            <b><font size="+3" color=#00368c>Activated random walk and the stochastic sandpile</font></b>
            <br>
            In the 1980s physicists Per Bak, Chao Tang and Kurt Wiesenfeld coined and popularized the idea of 'self organized criticality' (SOC),
            a phenomenon they observed in real-world systems like avalanches and forest fires. In these systems, energy slowly builds up over time,
            and is released in shocks with sizes that follow a statistical power law. They proposed a number of simple
            but mathematically challenging models to study SOC, including the sandpile model, a precursor to activated random walk (ARW).
            Deepak Dhar later proved that the sandpile has a certain abelian property, which is shared by activated random walk.

            Simulations suggest that ARW, a stochastic variant of the abelian sandpile, has a critical limiting state that exhibits SOC in a robust way, with little dependence on the exact setup
            of the model. Research on ARW has recently gained traction, and many results on the critical density are now available. Still,
            we lack a mathematical description of exactly how SOC arises for ARW. While the two-dimensional case is of particular practical interest,
            ARW in one dimension, on a tree, or in the mean field (on the complete graph) are more tractable, and are not yet fully solved.

            <br>
            A recurring theme in the study of large finite graphs is to describe hidden geometric features. For a given measure on random graphs,
            i.e. a random matrix ensemble, we can say it has <em>geometry</em> if it can be roughly-isometrically embedded in a low-dimensional metric space.
            For Wishart matrices, aka random graphs embedded in a sphere, one can exactly characterize the phase transition, depending on the underlying
            dimension, between geometry and no geometry. Another combinatorial graph model, called the random intersection graph, shares the same phase transition,
            at essentially the same critical value. This suggests a universal phenomenon: is it possible to characterize a large class of
            random graphs that undergo exhibit the same phase transition?

            <b><font size="+3" color=#00368c>Counting clusters in 2D percolation</font></b>
            <br>
            Consider independent site percolation on a finite graph, like a subset of Z^d or the hexagonal lattice.
            How many open clusters are there? For example, what is the expected number of clusters? For lattices, it is
            easy to see that the number of clusters is on the same order as the volume of the set you percolate. Can one establish
            a law of large numbers for the cluster count, and compute the limiting constant? The A5 problem from the 2004 Putnam exam
            was to prove a lower bound on this constant, but exactly determining it is a difficult problem. I considered this
            question for my undergraduate thesis, including proving upper and lower bounds.
