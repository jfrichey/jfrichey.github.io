            <div class="math">
                Fix a family of <em>forbidden</em> patterns on a transitive graph, i.e. some colorings of
                some finite subgraphs. Consider an iid coloring on the full graph (or a finite subset) conditioned to avoid
                all the forbidden patterns.
                What does a typical configuration look like, and what statistical properties does it have? This model originated
                in ergodic theory and symbolic dynamics, and lies at the intersection of probability, combinatorics, dynamics, and statistical physics.
                Many interesting questions arise already in the one dimensional setting. For example: consider bi-infinite binary words, and
                forbid a single binary pattern. The entropy of the resulting shift space (i.e. the exponential growth rate
                of the number of allowable words) is described by a simple combinatorial statistic, the auto-correlation polynomial
                of the forbidden word. In higher dimensions, computing the entropy or establishing mixing properties
                is much more challenging; and in the non-amenable setting, a nice notion of entropy is still not known.
                Another natural object is the asymptotic density of 1s, or of another fixed (allowable) pattern. Is there a
                similar combinatorial statistic that describes these densities?

            <div class="pj">Self organized criticality for abelian particle systems</div>
            <div class="math">
                In the 1980s physicists Per Bak, Chao Tang and Kurt Wiesenfeld coined and popularized the idea of <em>self organized criticality</em> (SOC),
                a phenomenon they observed in real-world systems like avalanches and forest fires. In these systems, energy slowly builds up over time,
                and is released in shocks with sizes that follow a statistical power law. They proposed a number of simple
                but mathematically challenging models to study SOC, including the abelian sandpile model, a precursor to <em>activated random walk</em> (ARW).
                Deepak Dhar later proved that the sandpile has a certain abelian property, which is shared by activated random walk.

                Simulations suggest that ARW has a critical limiting state that exhibits SOC in a robust way, with little dependence on the exact setup
                of the model. Research on ARW has recently gained traction, and many results on the critical density are now available. Still,
                we lack a mathematical description of exactly how SOC arises for ARW. While the two-dimensional case is of particular practical interest,
                ARW in one dimension, on a tree, or in the mean field (on the complete graph) are more tractable, and are not yet fully solved.

        <div class="math">
            A recurring theme in the study of large finite graphs is to describe hidden geometric features. For a given measure on random graphs,
            i.e. a random matrix ensemble, we can say it has <em>geometry</em> if it can be roughly-isometrically embedded in a low-dimensional metric space.
            For Wishart matrices, aka random graphs embedded in a sphere, one can exactly characterize the phase transition, depending on the underlying
            dimension, between geometry and no geometry. Another combinatorial graph model, called the random intersection graph, shares the same phase transition,
            at essentially the same critical value. This suggests a universal phenomenon: is it possible to characterize a large class of
            random graphs that undergo exhibit the same phase transition?

            A huge body of probability literature is devoted to studying random walks on graphs that are modified in some way,

            alternates taking random walk steps, and moving according to a permutation on the vertices. On a regular tree,
            the permuted random walk always moves away from the origin faster than the usual random walk. In what generality does this
            hold -- for other random walks, or other graphs?
