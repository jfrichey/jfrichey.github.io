        <div class="pj">Shifts of finite type</div>

            Fix a set a set of 'forbidden' patterns on a transitive graph, i.e. a finite set of colorings of
            some finite subgraphs. Consider an iid coloring the full graph conditioned to avoid all of the forbidden patterns.
            What does a typical configuration look like, and what statistical properties does it have? This model originated
            in ergodic theory and symbolic dynamics, and lies at the intersection of probability, combinatorics, dynamics, and statistical physics.
            Many interesting questions arise already in the one dimensional setting. For example: consider bi-infinite binary words, and
            forbid a single binary pattern. The entropy of the resulting shift space (i.e. the exponential growth rate
            of the number of allowable words) is described by a simple combinatorial statistic, the auto-correlation polynomial
            of the forbidden word. Another natural object is the asymptotic density of 1s, or of another fixed (allowable) pattern. Is there a
            similar combinatorial statistic that describes these densities?

        <div class="pj">Activated random walk and the stochastic sandpile</div>

            In the 1980s physicists Per Bak, Chao Tang and Kurt Wiesenfeld coined and popularized the idea of 'self organized criticality' (SOC),
            a phenomenon they observed in real-world systems like avalanches and forest fires. In these systems, energy slowly builds up over time,
            and is released in shocks with sizes that follow a statistical power law. They proposed a number of simple
            but mathematically challenging models to study SOC, including the sandpile model, a precursor to activated random walk (ARW).
            Deepak Dhar later proved that the sandpile has a certain abelian property, which is shared by activated random walk.

            Simulations suggest that ARW, a stochastic variant of the abelian sandpile, has a critical limiting state that exhibits SOC in a robust way, with little dependence on the exact setup
            of the model. Research on ARW has recently gained traction, and many results on the critical density are now available. Still,
            we lack a mathematical description of exactly how SOC arises for ARW. While the two-dimensional case is of particular practical interest,
            ARW in one dimension, on a tree, or in the mean field (on the complete graph) are more tractable, and are not yet fully solved.

        <div class="pj">Geometry detection in random graphs</div>

            A recurring theme in the study of large finite graphs is to describe hidden geometric features. For a given measure on random graphs,
            i.e. a random matrix ensemble, we can say it has <em>geometry</em> if it can be roughly-isometrically embedded in a low-dimensional metric space.
            For Wishart matrices, aka random graphs embedded in a sphere, one can exactly characterize the phase transition, depending on the underlying
            dimension, between geometry and no geometry. Another combinatorial graph model, called the random intersection graph, shares the same phase transition,
            at essentially the same critical value. This suggests a universal phenomenon: is it possible to characterize a large class of
            random graphs that undergo exhibit the same phase transition?

        <div class="pj">Finding the source</div>

            Run a random growth model or diffusion on a graph up to a fixed time. Given only a snapshot of the set of
            sites visited by the process, what information can be determined about the process? Can you guess the starting point,
            the ending point, most visited point, or the distribution of the process? These kinds of questions arise in
            applied computer science, for example in infection spread through a social network. Giving a precise answer
            for simple random walk in Z^d is already a difficult problem.

        <div class="pj">Permuted Random Walk</div>

            A huge body of probability literature is devoted to studying random walks on graphs that are modified in some way,
            often with the goal of decreasing the mixing time. In this work we considered permuted random walk, a process
            alternates taking random walk steps, and moving according to a permutation on the vertices. On a regular tree,
            the permuted random walk always moves away from the origin faster than the usual random walk. In what generality does this
            hold -- for other random walks, or other graphs?

        <div class="pj">Counting clusters in 2D percolation</div>

            Consider independent site percolation on a finite graph, like a subset of Z^d or the hexagonal lattice.
            How many open clusters are there? For example, what is the expected number of clusters? For lattices, it is
            easy to see that the number of clusters is on the same order as the volume of the set you percolate. Can one establish
            a law of large numbers for the cluster count, and compute the limiting constant? In fact, A5 problem from the 2004 Putnam exam
            asked to prove a lower bound on this constant! But exactly determining it is a difficult problem.

        <div class="pj">Stochastic geometry</div>

            Consider an iid sequence of random sets, or a Poisson point process of hyperplanes or sets in a metric space.
            One can ask many natural questions related to the 'coverage' of such a family of sets: what is their union?
            What is the distribution of the random field counting how many times each point is covered by the union?
            If the sequence is confined, what is the intersection of the sets? A canonical limit object, called the Crofton
            cell, arises as the scaling limit of the region containing the origin in a standard hyperplane tesselation of R^d.

        <div class="pj">Combinatorial stochastic processes</div>

            I am fascinated by random combinatorial objects: markov chains, fragmentation/coagulation processes,
            interacting particle systems, random number theory. Proving limit theorems, describing stationary
            configurations or evolutions, or studying mean field behavior of these systems, to name a few objectives,
            often leads to cutting edge ideas and unsolved problems.
